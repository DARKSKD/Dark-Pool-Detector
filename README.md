# Dark Pool Detective Platform

## Overview

The **Dark Pool Detective Platform** is a real-time market surveillance and forensic analytics system designed to detect hidden liquidity patterns, large block trades, and manipulative trading behaviors commonly associated with dark pool activity.

The platform implements multiple **order-flow detection algorithms**, a **real-time visualization dashboard**, and a **forensic investigation suite** to reconstruct suspicious trading behavior.

## Running the Project (Local – PRIVATE)

### Backend
> ⚠️ Flask development server is **not** used for deployment.  
> Backend runs on a **production WSGI server (Waitress)**.

cd backend
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install waitress
python app.py

Run backend using Waitress:

``` waitress-serve --host=127.0.0.1 --port=5000 app:app  ```

Backend available at: http://localhost:5000

### Frontend 

cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview

Frontend runs at: http://localhost:4173
